# Survey Wolf Discord App

Survey wolf is a Discord App that aims to connect community managers with their communities.
Survey Wolf offers an easy to use interface allowing information and feedback to be given to community mangers.
Survey Wolf allows for the seamless creation of multiple types of questions within Discords user interface.
Users can then take the survey, also within Discord, and the results can be viewed by community managers.
Survey Wolf utilizes Discords newest features such as slash commands and buttons to create a user friendly interface. 

Currently, Survey Wolf is being hosted by me and is publicly available for free.

### Getting Support

In the case that you encounter any of these, or you just have general questions you can join the support Discord server 
[here](https://discord.gg/f39cJ9D).

I am more than happy to discuss issues or feature requests with the community.

### Contributing
At this time Survey Wolf is a passion project.
If you would like to contribute please contact me in the support server linked above.
I am more than happy to have 3rd party contributions, but I would like to discuss changes to ensure they align with 
Survey Wolfs goals before you spend time implementing them.

### Motivation
I created Survey Wolf to fill a hole I saw in Discord. 
I often saw Discord servers linking to off platform survey services.
This likely led to lower survey response counts and a higher risk for users, needing to click a link.
Of the existing Discord bots that had similar functionality to Survey Wolf, I had three complaints:
- They only offer one type of question, often multiple choice.
- They only allow one question not a full survey like structure.
- They were not using discords newest user interface features.
  - This led to confused users not knowing how to interact with the bot, 
or even just disappointed with how cumbersome it was to use.
  - The bot requiring elevated permissions.

Additionally, I have loved working on Discord bots and interacting with the Discord development community.
I have also learned a lot, and plan to continue learning and improving my skills with this project.
